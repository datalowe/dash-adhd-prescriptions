# ADHD medication in Sweden
This is a [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) project where data on ADHD medication for 0-17-year-olds, in 2016 and 2020, in Sweden are presented using a map and an interactive data table (the latter is yet to be implemented). The data are from [Socialstyrelsen](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/). Latitudes/longitudes of Swedish municipalities are based on data from [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/).
